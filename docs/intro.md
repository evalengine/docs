Eval Engine is a decentralized framework for evaluating AI agents with a focus on crypto-native agents.&#x20;

> Built on Chromia blockchain - a gas-free relational blockchain that enables seamless user experience without transaction fees.&#x20;

The system consists of three key components:

1. **Chromia Blockchain**: Acts as a transparent, immutable, gas-free database
2. **Engine**: The evaluation service
3. **Client**: The end user requesting evaluations

### Think of it as a Distinguished Food Critic

Eval Engine is like a World-Renowned Food Critic. While their evaluation criteria remain private, their final ratings and reviews are public and immutable. Eval Engine works similarly - it processes evaluations through multiple specialized models but records all results transparently on Chromia blockchain. Like a prestigious restaurant rating that can't be bought or manipulated, Eval Engine ensures evaluation integrity through blockchain technology.
